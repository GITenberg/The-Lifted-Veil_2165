description: <p><b>Horror was my familiar.</b><br><br> Published the same year as
  her first  novel, <i>Adam Bede</i>, this overlooked work displays the gifts for
  which George Eliot  would become famous--gritty realism, psychological insight,
  and idealistic moralizing.  It is unique from all her other writing, however, in
  that it represents the only  time she ever used a first-person narrator, and it
  is the only time she wrote about  the supernatural.<br><br> The tale of a man who
  is incapacitated by visions of the future  and the cacophony of overheard thoughts,
  and yet who can't help trying to subvert  his vividly glimpsed destiny, it is easy
  to read <i>The Lifted Veil </i>as being autobiographically  revealing--of Eliot's
  sensitivity to public opinion and her awareness that her days  concealed behind
  a pseudonym were doomed to a tragic unveiling (as indeed came to  pass soon after
  this novella's publication). But it is easier still to read the story  as the exciting
  and genuine precursor of a moody new form, as well as an absorbing  early masterpiece
  of suspense.<br><br> <b>The Art of The Novella Series<br><br> </b>Too short to be
  a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by
  academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's
  greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this
  renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances,
  presented in book form for the first time.
